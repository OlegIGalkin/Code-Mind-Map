# Code Mind Map VS Code Extension

An extension for creating mind maps with nodes linked to code. Easily add code snippets as nodes and navigate between the mind map and your code files.

## 1. Open the Mind Map Window
- Run the `Open Code Mind Map Panel` command from the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P)

## 2. Add Code as a Node
- Select any code in the editor (or place the caret on a line)
- Press `Ctrl+2, Ctrl+2` to add it as a new node in the mind map, linked to that code

## 3. Navigate to Linked Code
`Ctrl+Click` any node in the mind map to jump directly to the linked code.

## 4. Organize & Connect Nodes
- Drag and drop nodes to rearrange
- Right-click to edit, delete, or add connections

That's it! Start visualizing and navigating your code faster with **Code Mind Map**.

> **Tip:** Use the toolbar buttons for quick actions like saving/loading maps.
